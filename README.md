# NextImage AI

What it does:
- Uses the OpenAI API to generate any image based on a prompt given or a random prompt selected from the menu
- Incorporates a UI/UX page
- Has a community page, where images are stored in a MongoDB database and will display shared images that users choose to share

Things I learned:
- Setting up the OpenAI API to work on projects, while figuring out how to handle API requests
- Using Vite to create a project instead of Next.js
- Learned Tailwind CSS and its configuration
- Creating route files, to use for APIs
- Using a MongoDB database, and learning how to connect with it while creating schemas
- Creating a backend server which uses route files as well as a database
- Creating a client-side as well as server-side instead of just using one file
- Handling error-catching in route files as well as main indexes

Next Goals:
- Moving on to improve my backend abilities, node.js + MongoDB (MERN STACK)
- Improving on Typescript (Used JS for this project) as well as React skills
- Improving on Tailwind CSS
